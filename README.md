# Running the Code

To execute the code in Google Colab, follow these steps:

## Change Runtime Type:

Change the runtime type to R in Google Colab. This ensures that you can run R code seamlessly.

## Add Dataset to Colab Environment:

Upload the dataset ("EngreitzLabACBDataSet.txt") to the Colab environment. You can either upload it directly or mount Google Drive to access it if it's stored there.

## Run the Code:

Once the dataset is available in the Colab environment, run the provided R code. Ensure that all necessary libraries are installed, and the code is executed sequentially.

# Report

I've attached the ACB Data Analysis Quiz report (ACB Data Analysis Quiz - KC.pdf), which contains my responses to the questions provided in the quiz. You can find the report in the repository for your review.

In the report, I've provided detailed analyses and insights based on the given dataset, addressing the questions and objectives outlined in the quiz. Each section of the report corresponds to a specific question or task, organized in a clear and structured manner for easy reference and understanding.
